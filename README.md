# Media-Framing-Analysis-in-Fraud-Scandals

Building on prior research on Media framing in Wirecard’s fraud scandal , Media Framing refers to how the media shapes public perception and discourse by selecting certain aspects of a story and making them salient through rhetoric and stylistic devices.
The research identified 6 distinct frames in media coverage of the Wirecard fraud scandal. For a project in 2209491 PROJ LANG TECH I, the senior project course in the Language and Information Technology curriculum, we aim to develop a machine learning classifier to automate media framing analysis.
We aspire to contribute to the growing field of computational social science, providing tools to further investigate the media’s role in shaping public opinion and constructing narratives around corporate and institutional accountability.

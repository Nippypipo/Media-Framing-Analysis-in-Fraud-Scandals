# ðŸ“° **Media Framing Classifier for Fraud Scandals**
   - **Description:** A project aimed at developing a machine learning classifier to automate media framing analysis, building on prior research in media framing related to Wirecardâ€™s fraud scandal. This project focuses on how media shapes public perception through specific rhetorical techniques and stylistic devices.
   - **Objective:** 
     - **Accurate Framing Classifier**: 
       - Automate media framing analysis to enhance productivity and allow deeper insights into how events are portrayed by different media outlets.
       - Address key research questions, such as:
         - How do specific frames emerge and evolve during a scandal?
         - How does framing vary across media outlets?
     - **Multilingual and Generalizable Model**: 
       - Design a model capable of handling multiple languages and adapting to different fraud cases across linguistic contexts.
       - Enable analyses of fraud cases in low-resource languages.
       - Explore cases like:
         - **The Enron fraud (USA, October 2001)** â€“ predominantly covered in English.
         - **The Parmalat fraud (Italy, December 2003)** â€“ widely reported in Italian.
   - **Tools/Technologies:** Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Multilingual Models
   - **Key Achievements:**
     - Development of a machine learning classifier for media framing in fraud scandals.
     - Enabled multilingual analysis for varying cases across linguistic contexts.
